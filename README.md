# Mini-Annapurna: A Python-Only Cycle-Accurate Simulator & Compiler for a Systolic AI Accelerator

**Version 1.0** | **License: MIT**

## Project Elevator Pitch

Mini-Annapurna is an open-source, hardware-free reference stack that shows how PyTorch operations are lowered to a custom systolic-array ISA, scheduled, and executed under a cycle-accurate performance model. Built in ~500 lines of Python to demonstrate the exact skill-set AWS Annapurna Labs expects from 2026 silicon & AI-systems interns: **compiler construction**, **hardware–software co-design**, and **performance analysis**.
